## Project Overview
This project contains automated API tests for the **Trello API**. The tests are written as a **Postman collection** and can be executed locally using **Newman** or via **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. The project also generates HTML reports for test execution results.

---

## Project Goals
- Validate the functionality of the Trello API endpoints.
- Automate testing of key workflows such as creating boards, lists, and cards.
- Ensure proper handling of authentication, error messages, and invalid input scenarios.
- Generate test reports automatically for continuous integration.


---

## Technologies and Tools
* **Newman** – command-line runner for Postman collections.
* **Postman** – API client to create collections and environments.
* **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD workflow to run tests automatically.
* **HTML Reporter** – generates readable HTML test reports.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celiapaivab/trello-api.git
cd trello-api
```
2. Install Newman globally (if not installed):
```bash
npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
```
3. Run the collection with environment variables:
```bash
newman run collections/trello_API_collection.json \
  --env-var "trelloKey=<YOUR_TRELLO_KEY>" \
  --env-var "trelloToken=<YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN>" \
  -r cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export reports/trello_report.html
```
4. Check the `reports/` folder for the generated HTML report.


---

## Results
- All endpoints are tested.
- Test results are displayed in the CLI and saved as HTML reports.
- Examples of tested scenarios:
  * GET /members/me/boards
  * POST /boards
  * GET /boards/\:id
  * POST /boards/\:id/lists
  * POST /cards
  * PUT /cards/\:id (moving cards between lists)
  * DELETE /boards/\:id
  * Error handling for unauthorized access and invalid input

---

## What I Learned
- How to structure API tests using **Postman collections** and environments.
- How to run Postman tests locally with **Newman**.
- How to dynamically inject environment variables (e.g., Trello API tokens) in CI/CD pipelines.
- Integration of API tests with **GitHub Actions** to generate automated HTML reports.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add **more detailed test coverage** for edge cases, such as concurrent card creation.
- Parameterize collections to test multiple environments or API keys.
- Add **visual regression** tests for Trello board states.
